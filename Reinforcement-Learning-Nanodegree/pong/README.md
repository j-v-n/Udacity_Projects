# Atari Pong

By Jayanth Nair

### OpenAI Gym Exercise
Play Pong using Policy Gradient based RL methods

### Project Details
In this project, I train multiple agents in parallel environments to play Pong

At each step, the agents choose one of 2 actions:
- FIRERIGHT
- FIRELEFT

I train the agents for 2000 episodes

### Getting Started
- The virtual environment used for this task is saved in the environment.yml file.  


### Notebooks and Scripts
- pong_utils.py -> Utilities script from Udacity DeepRL Nanodegree course
- parallel_Env.py -> Parallelized implementation of OpenAI gym
- pong_REINFORCE.py -> My solution with REINFORCE
