# Project 1 - Navigation

By Jayanth Nair

### Unity-ML Agents Project
Navigate around the Unity Banana Collector Environment, collecting yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Linux Based)

### Notebooks and Scripts
- Navigation.ipynb -> Environment state based experimentation notebook
- my_model.py -> PyTorch implementation of a fully connected neural network used in the DQN
- dqn_agent.py -> Defines all functions of the DQN Agent

### To-Do
[x] - Vanilla DQN Implementation
[ ] - Double DQN
[ ] - Prioritized Experience Replay
[ ] - Dueling DQN
[ ] - Navigation Using Only Visual Inputs
